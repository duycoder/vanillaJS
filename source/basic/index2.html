    <!-- 
        VALUES
        *) cú pháp js định nghĩa 2 kiểu giá trị: "fixed values" và "variable values"
     -->

    <script>
        // JS LITERALS
        // numbers area written with or without decimals:
        var x = 10;
        var y = 10.6;

        // string are text, written within double or single quotes
        var name = "John Doe";
        var name2 = 'John Doe';

        //JS VARIABLES
        // variables used to stored data
        // js use var keyword to declare variables
        // an "equal sign" used to "assign values" to variables
        var myX = 6; //declare variable named "myX" and "assign" value "6" for "myX"

        //JS OPERATORS
        // uses arithmetic operators (+ - * /) to "compute values"

        //JS EXPRESSIONS
        // an expression is combination of variables, values, operators to return a value.

        //JS KEYWORS
        // a keyword is to identify actions to be performed. Exp: like "var" keyword tells browsers to create a variables

        //JS IDENTIFIERS
        // they're names
        // in js identifiers used to name variables, keywords, functions, labels, ...
        // first character must be letter, underscore(_) or dollar sign($).
        // numbers are not allowed to be first character to distinguish identifiers from numbers
        // js identifiers does not allow hyphens(-) to be the name of a variables


        //JS IS CASE SENSITIVE
        // all js identifiers are case sensitive
        // so "lastName" is not equal to "lastname"


        //JS COMMENTS
        // js comments can be used to explain js code, and make it more readable
        // js comment also can be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code

        //SINGLE LINE COMMENTS
        // they start with '//' and the end will be ignored by js
        // they can be used before each line of code, or at the end of each line of code

        //MULTI-LINE COMMENTS
        // they start with '/*' and end with '*/'
        // they often used for formal documentation

        //JS VARIABLES
        // js variables are containers to store data

        //JS IDENTIFIERS
        // all js variables must be identified with unique names
        // these unique names are called identifiers
        // identifiers can be short (x or y) or more descriptive name (age, sum, totalPrice)
        // names can contain letters, digits, underscores, dollar signs
        // names can begin with letters
        // name can also begins with $ and _
        // names are case sensitive( y != Y)
        // reserved words (like JS keywords) can not be used as names

        //ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
        // js the sign(=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator
        // this is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra
        // x = x + 5
        // in js, they make perfect sense: it assignes values of "x + 5" to "x"
        // it calculates the value of "x + 5" and puts result into "x". The value of "x" is incremented by 5
        // the "equal to" operator is written like "==" in JS

        // JAVASCRIPT DATA TYPES
        // js variables can hold numbers like 100 and text like "john doe"
        // text values are called text string
        // js variables can hold many types of data
        // strings are written inside doulbe or single quotes, numbers are written with out quotes
        // if u put a number into quotes, it will be treated as string

        var pi = 3.14;
        var person = 'John Son';
        var answer = 'Yes! I am';

        // DECLARING VARIABLES
        // creating variables in js is called delaring variables

        // in js, you declare variables with the "var" keywords
        var carName;

        // after declaration, the variable has no value (technically is has the value of "undefined")
        // to assign value to variable, use the equal sign
        carName = 'Volvo';

        // you guys can also assign value to variable when you declare it
        // var carName = 'Volvo';
        // It is a very good programming practice to declare all the variables at the beginning of a script

        //ONE STATEMENT, MANY VARIABLES
        // you can declare many varibles in one statement
        // start with the "var" keyword and seperate variables by "comma":
        var actor = 'Mark WalhBerg', actress = 'Meryl Streep', film = 'Black Panther';
        var boy = 'Nguyễn Ngọc Duy', girl = 'Nguyễn Hồng Vân', father = 'Nguyễn Xuân Điều', mother = 'Nguyễn Thị Nhã';

        //they can span into multiple lines
        var firstLang = 'Vietnamese',
            secondLang = 'English',
            thirdLang = 'Spainish';

        //VALUE = undefined
        // in computer program, variables are often declared without value
        // the value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input
        // a variable without a value will have the value "undefined"

        //REDECLARE VARIABLES
        // if you re-declare a js variable, it will not lose its value
        // the variale below still have the value "Mercedes" after the execution of these statements

        var germanCar = 'Mercedes';
        var germanCar;
        console.log(germanCar);

        //ARITHMETIC
        // this is a weird part of js
        // var x = "5" + 2 + 3 => 523
        // var x = 2 + 3 + "5" => 55

        //THE OPERATORS AND OPERANDS
        // the numbers (arithmetic operation) are called "operands"
        // the operator (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator

        // var heaven = 99 + 100 => "99" and "100" are operands and "+" is operator

        //REMAINDER
        // in modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder
        // var x = 5;
        // var y = 2;
        // var z = x % y;
        // in arithmetic, the division of 2 integers produces "quotient" and "remainder"
        // in mathematics, the result of "modulo operation" is the "remainder" of an arithmetic division


        //PRECEDENCE
        // multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher "precedence" than addition (+) and subtraction (-)
        // precedence can be changed by using parentheses
        // precedence is computed from left to right

        //ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
        /*
            x = x << y
            x = x >> y
            x = x >>> y
            x = x & y
            x = x ^ y
            x = x | y
            x = x ** y
        */

        //DATA TYPES
        // js variables can hold many "data types": numbers, string, object and more
        var length = 16; //number 
        var lastName = 'Johnson'; //String
        var x = {
            firstName: 'John',
            lastName: 'Doe'
        } //Object

        //THE CONCEPT OF DATA TYPES
        // to be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type
        // without a data types, a computer cannot safely solve this

        var x1 = 22 + 'Volvo';

        //js evaluates expressions from left to right. Different sequences can produce different results:
        // var x = 16 + 4 + 'Volvo' => 20Volvo => js treats "16 + 4" as "number", until it reaches "Volvo"
        // var x = 'Volvo' + 16 + 4 => Volvo164 => since the 1st operand is a string, all operands are treated as string

        //JAVASCRIPT TYPES ARE DYNAMIC
        // js has dynamic types, this meant that the same variable can be used to hold different data types
        //var x = 'John'
        //x = 1996
        //x = {}

        //JS STRINGS
        // is the series of character like "John Doe"
        // are written in quotes. You can use single or double quotes
        // var carName = 'Volvo' or carName = "Volvo"

        //JS NUMBERS
        // there is only one type of number in jS
        // numbers can be written with or without decimals
        var numb = 245,
            numb = 245.00;

        //extra large or small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation:
        var yy = 123e5; //12300000
        var zz = 123e-5; //0.00123

        //JS BOOLEANS
        // booleans have only 2 values: "true" or "false"

        var water = 'water';
        var air = 'air';
        console.log(water == air);

        //ARRAYS
        // always written in square brackets
        // array items are seperated by commas (,)
        // the code beblow declares (creates) an array containing 3 items:
        var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];


        //OBJECTS
        // js objects are written in curly braces
        // object properties are written as "name": "value" pairs, seperated by commas

        var singer = {
            name: 'Snoop Dogg',
            genre: 'Rap, R&B',
            country: 'USA'
        }

        //THE "typeof" OPERATORS
        // you can use "typeof" operator to find the type of JavaScript variable
        typeof "";
        typeof 5;
        typeof undefined;
        //if you declare a variable without assign a value to it, it's "typeof" will be "undefined"

        //NULL
        // in js, "null" is "nothing" but the data type of "null" is "object"


        //NULL VS UNDEFINED
        // null and undefined are equal in value but different in type
        typeof undefined //undefined
        typeof null //object

        undefined == null //true
        undefined === null //false

        //PRIMITIVE DATA
        // a primitive data value is a single simple data value with no additional properties and methods
        // the "typeof" operator can return on of 4 types: "string", "number", "boolean", "undefined"

        typeof 'John';
        typeof 3.14;
        typeof true;
        typeof false;
        typeof xxx;

        //COMPLEX DATA
        //the "typeof" operator can return one of 2 complex types: "function" - "object"
        //the "typeof" operator returns object both objects, arrays and null
        //the "typeof" operator does not return objects for function

        typeof { name: 'John', age: 34 };
        typeof [1, 2, 3, 4];
        typeof null;
        typeof function myFunc() { };
