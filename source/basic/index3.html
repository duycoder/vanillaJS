        //js is loosely typed and dynamic language
        //variables in js is not associated with any particular value type
        //an variables can be assigned (and re-assigned) value off all types

        var foo = 52 //foo is a number
        var foo = 'bar' //foo is a String
        var foo = true //foo is a boolean

       //   there are 7 data types in javascript (according to ECMAScript)
       //   6 primitive types: boolean, null, undefined, string, number, symbol (new)
       //   and Object


        //  all types in js (except object) define immutable values(values, which is
        //  incapable of being changed)

        //BOOLEAN TYPE
        //  this type represents a logical entity and can have 2 values: "true" or "false"

        //NULL TYPE
        // this type has exactly one value: "null"

        //UNDEFINED TYPE
        //  a variable that has not been assigned a value has the value "undefined".

        //NUMBER TYPE
        //  there is only one number type
        //  range -(2^53 - 1) to (2^53 - 1)
        //  being able to represent floating point numbers
        //  3 symbolic values: "NaN" - "-Infinity" - "+Infinity"
        //  to check max/min value => use: Number.MAX_VALUE - Number.MIN_VALUE
        //  in ECMAScript, to check if a number is in double-precision floating-point number rang: Number.isSafeInteger()
        //  if out of this ranges, the integers in jS is no longer safe and has to be double-precision floating point approximate of value
        //  check max/min safe integers: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER - NUMBER.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER.
        //  0 is the only number that has 2 representations: -0 and +0
        //  -0 === +0 (this is true).
        //  but when you divide by zero
        //  1996/+0 = +Infinity
        //  1996/-0 = -Infinity

        //STRING TYPE
        //  represent textual data
        //  it is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values
        //  each element in the String "occupies" a position in the String
        //  jS string is immutable, once the string is created, it is not possible to modify it
        //  it is posible to create another string based on an operation on original string. String.subStr() - String.concat()


        //"stringly-typing" CODE
        //  it can be tempting to use string to represents complex data with short term benefits:
        //  => easy to build complex string with concatenation
        //  => string is easy to debug
        //  => strings are common denominator with alot of APIs(input field, local storage, values, XmlHttpRequest)

        //  with conventions, it is posible to represent any data structure in a string
        //  this is not a good idea. With seperator, one can "emulate" a list (while jS array is suitable)
        //  when the separator is used in one of the "list" elements, then the "list" is broken, so maybe a escape character can be chosen
        //  all of this requires conventions and creates an unnecessary maintennance burden
        //  so use string for textual data, when reprenting complex data, parse strings and use appropriate abstraction

        //SYMBOL TYPE
        //  is a "unique" and "immutable" primitive value and maybe used as they key of Object property

        //Objects
        //  in computer science, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by a "identifier"
        //  Properties
        //  in jS, objects can be seen as a collection of properties
        //  with object literal syntax, a limited set of properties are initialized, then properties can be added and removed
        //  property values can be value of any type, including other objects => which enable to build complex data structure
        //  properties are identified using key values. A key value is either a "String" or "Symbol" value
        
        //  there are 2 types of object properties: "data property" and "accessor property"
        
        //  data property: associates a key with a value has 4 attributes
        // [[value]]: (any js Type) the value retrieve by "get access" of the property
        // [[writeable]]: (boolean) if "false" the [[value]] can't be changed
        // [[enumerable]]: (boolean) if "true", the property will be "enumerated" in "for... in loops"
        // [[configurable]]: (boolean) if "false", the property can't be deleted and attributes other than [[value]] and [[writeable]] can't be chagned

        //  accessor property: associates a key with one or two accessor functions(get and set) to retreive or store a value
        //  and has the following attributes
        // [[get]]: (function object or undefined): a f(x) is called with empty args and retreives the property value whenever
        //  a get access to the value is performed
        
        // [[set]]: (function object or undefined): a f(x) is called with an arg that contains the assigned value and is executed
        // whenever a specified property is attempted to be changed

        // [[enumerable]]: (boolean) if "true", the property will be "enumerated" in "for ... in loops"
        // [[configurable]]: (boolean) if "false", the property can't be deleted and can't be changed to a data property

        //  the attribute in jS is used by javascript engine, so you can't directly access it. That's why the attribute
        //  is put in double square brackets insted of single

        //NORMAL OBJECT AND FUNCTIONS
        //  a js object is mapping between key and values. Key are "Strings" (or "Symbols")
        //  and value can be anything. This makes object natural fit of "hashmaps"
        
        // functions are regular object with the additional capability of being callable

        //DATES
        // when representing dates, the best choices is use the built-in "Date Utility" in jS
        
        //INDEXED COLLECTIONS: Arrays and Typed Arrays
        // "Array" is regular object which there is particular relationship between integer-key-ed properties
        //  and "length" property
        // "Arrays" inherited from "Array.prototype" which provides them a handful of convinient methods to  manipulate array
        // "Arrays" is perfect candidate to represent lists or sets

        // "Typed Arrays" are new to JS and present an array-like view of an underlaying binary data buffer


        //KEYED COLLECTIONS: maps, sets, weakmaps, weaksets
        //  these data structures take object references as keys and are introduced in ECMAScript 6
        //  set - weakSet represent a set of object
        //  map - weakMap associate a value to object
        //  map != weakMap is in the former, object keys can be enumerated over. This allows garbage collection optimizations
        //  in latter case
        //  object can not be compared, so look-up performance necessarily be linear. native implementations
        //  of them can have look-up performance that is approximately logarithm to constant time
        //  when you want bind a data to a "DOM" node, you can set properties directly on the object or use "data-" attributes
        //  this has a downside that "data" is available to any script that running in the same context
        //  Maps and WeakMaps make it easy to privately bind data to an object

        //STRUCTURED DATA JSON
        //  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is lightweight data interchange format, derived from javascript
        //  but used in many programming language.
        //  JSON builds universal data structures
        

        //FUNCTIONS
        // jS function is a block of code that execute particular task
        // jS function executed when "something" invokes (call) it.

        //FUNCTION SYNTAX
        // a js function defined with a "function" keyword, followed by "name", followed by parentheses "()"
        // function names can contain letters, digit, underscore and dollar sign ($)
        // the parentheses my include parameter names separated by comma (,) "(param1, param2, ...)"
        // the code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curley brackets "{}"

        //"parameters" (biến) are the listed inside the "parentheses ()" in function definition
        //"arguments" (tham số) are the "values" received by function when it is invoked

        //FUNCTION INVOCATION
        // the code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) it
        // when event occurs (like click a button)
        // when it is invokes from js code
        // automatically (self invoked)

        //FUNCTION  RETURN
        // when js reaches "return statement", the function will stop executing
        // if the function was invoked from a statement, js will "return" to execute the code after invoking statement
        // functions often "compute" a "return value". The return value is "returned" back to the "caller"

        //WHY FUNCTION
        // reuse code, defined code once and use it many times
        // use the same code any times with different arguments, to produce different results

        //THE OPERATOR "()" INVOKES THE FUNCTION
        // accessing a function without "()" will return the "function definition" instead of "function result"

        //FUNCTION USED AS VARIABLES
        // function can be used the sameway as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments and calculation

        //OBJECTS
        // real life objects, properties, and methods
        // a "car" has properties like weight and color, and "method" like "start" and "stop"
        // all cars have same properties, but property "values" are different from car to car
        // all cars have same method, but method are performed "at different times"
        // js variables are containers for data values
        // js objects are variables too, but objects can contain many "values"
        // the values are written as "name:value" pairs (name and value are separated by a colon)
        // js objects are containers for named values called "properties" or "method"

        //OBJECT DEFINITION
        // you define object with an object literal

        //OBJECT PROPERTIES
        // the "name:value" pairs in js are call "properties"

        //ACCESSING OBJECT PROPERTIES
        // you can access object properties in 2 ways
        // objectName.propertyName
        // objectName["propertyName"]

        //OBJECT METHOD
        // objects can also have methods
        // method are "actions" that can be performed on objects
        // methods are stored in properties as "function definitions"
        // a method is a function stored as a property

        //THE "THIS" KEYWORD
        // in function definition, "this" refer to the "owner" of the function
        
        //ACCESSING METHOD OBJECTS
        // you access an object method with the following syntax: objectName.methodName()
        // if you access without "()", it will return "function definition"

        //DO NOT DECLARE STRINGS, NUMBERS, AND BOOLEANS as OBJECTS
        // when a js variable is declared with the "new" keyword, the variable is created as an object

        var x = new String();
        var y = new Number();
        var z = new Boolean();

        // avoid string, number, boolean objects, they complicated your code and slowdown the execution speed


        //JAVASCRIPT EVENTS
        // html events are "things" that happen to HTML elements
        // when js used in html pages, js can "react" on these events
        // events can be something browser does (finish loading)
        // or something that use does (input field was changed) or a html button was clicked
        // js let you executes code when events are detected
        // html allows event handler attributes, "with javascript code", to be added to HTML elements
        
        // single quote <element event='some js code'/> or double quotes <element event="some js code">
        // all html dom events: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp


        //STRINGS
        // js strings are used for storing and manipulating text
        // a js string is zero or more characters written inside quotes
        // var x = "JOHN DOE"

        //STRING LENGTH
        // the length of string is found in the built in property "length"
        // var txt = "ABC"
        // var sln = txt.length

        //SPECIAL CHARACTERS
        // the backslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string character
        // EXP: \', \", \\

        //six others
        // \b: backspace
        // \f: form feed
        // \n: newline
        // \r: carriage return
        // \t: horizontal tabulator
        // \v: vertical tabulator
        // all six above were originally designed to control typewriters, teletypes, fax machines. they do not make any
        // sense in HTML.

        //BREAKING LONG CODE LINE
        // for best readability, often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters
        // if js statements does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after operator
        document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML =
        'DEMO';

        //STRINGS CAN BE OBJECTS
        // normally, js strings are primitive values, created from literals
        // var firstName = "JOHN";
        // but string can be defined as objects with keyword "new"
        // var firstName = new String("JOHN")

        // var x = "JOHN"
        // var y = new String("JOHN")
        // using == operator, equal string are equal
        // using === operator, equal strings are not equal, because the === operator expects equality both type and value
        // object can't be compare so it always return "false" when you compare it.


        //NUMBERS
        //js has only one type of number, numbers can be written with or without decimals
        //var x = 3.14;
        //var y = 3;

        // js numbers are always 64 bit floating point
        // js does not define different types of numbers: integers, short, long, floating point
        // js numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers, following IEEE 754 standard
        // this format stores numbers in 64bit, where the number (the fraction) is stored in bits 0 to 51, the exponent in bits 52 to 62
        // and the sign in bit 63

        //PRECISION
        // integers (number without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits
        // var x = 999999999999999;   // x will be 999999999999999
        // var y = 9999999999999999;  // y will be 10000000000000000

        // the maximum number of decimal is 17, but floating point arithmethic is not 100% accurate
        // var x = 0.2 + 0.1 ==> x = 0.30000000000000004
        // to solve this, it helps to multiply and divide
        // var x = (0.2 * 10 + 0.1 * 10)/10 => x will be 0.3


        // javascript will try to converts string to number in all numeric opertions
        // var x = "100"
        // var y = "10"
        // var z = x - y => x = 90
        // but js will use '+' operator to concatenate strings


        //NaN - NOT A NUMBER
        // NaN is a reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number
        // trying to do arithmethic with a non-numeric string will result in NaN
        // var x = 100 / 'Apple' //x will be NaN (not a number)
        // however if the string contains a numeric value, the result will be a number
        // var x = 100 / '10'
        // you can use the global js function "isNaN()" to find out if a value is a number
        // NaN is a number, "typeof" NaN will return "number"
        typeof(NaN);

        //INFINITY
        // infinity(-infinity) is the value that js will return if you calculate a number outside the largest possible numbers
        // division by zero will give "Infinity" values
        // but infinity is a number, type of Infinity will return "number"

        //HEXADECIMAL
        // js inteprets numeric constants as hexadecimal if they are preceded by 0x
        // var x = 0xFF => x will be 255
        // never write a number with a leading zero cuz some js versions intepret numbers as octal if they written with a leading zero
        // by default js display number as "base 10" decimals
        // but you can use the "toString()" method to output numbers from "base 2" to "base 36"
        // hexadicmal is "base 16", decimal is "base 0", octal is "base 8", binary is "base 2"


        //NUMBER CAN BE OBJECT
        // normaly numbers are primitive values created from literals: var x = 123;
        // but numbers can also defined as objects with the keyword new: var y = new Number(123)

        //JAVASCRITP ARRAYS
        // js arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable
        // var cars = ['Saab', 'Volvo', 'BMW'];

        // arrays is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time
        // arrays can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number
        

        //CREATING ARRAY
        // the easiest way is to using array literal
        // var array_name = [item1, item2, ...];
        // or you can use the "new" keyword
        // var array_name = new Array(item1, item2)

        //ARRAYS ARE OBJECT
        // arrays are special type of objects. It uses numbers to access it's elements
        // var person = ['Ronaldo', 'Messi', 'Aguero']; => person[0] = 'Ronaldo';

        //ARRAYS ELEMENTS CAN BE OBJECTS
        // js variables can be objects, array are special kinds of objects
        // because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same array
        // you can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array
        //myArr[0] = new Date();
        //myArr[1] = new Number();
        //myArr[2] = new String('demo');

        //ARRAYS PROPERTY AND METHODS
        // the real strength of array in js are built-in array properties and methods
        // myArr.length; => the length property return the number of elements
        // myArr.sort(); => the sort() method to "sort" array

        //LOOPING ARRAY ELEMENTS
        // the best way to loop through array, is using  "for" loop
